# Safari Game

This is the solution for the *Safari* test questions.

Some notes regarding the conditions:

1. Classes, and especially polymorphisms do not constitute for efficient coding in this case.
2. Recursion is not an optimal solution for this question.
3. For some reason, the initial cell is expanded into as well, I kept this behaviour, despite it being not intuitive from the rules.

The repo contains two solutions: `required.py` and `efficient.py`. In the first file, it is implemented according to the requirements, while in the second, it is implemented *efficiently*.

I used only the built-ins, so the code is not very pretty in some places.
